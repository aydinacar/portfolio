        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          I started my journey with Web Design & Coding in 2017, continued with Computer Engineering, and focused my
          career on building real-world frontend systems.
          <br />
          <br />I specialize in admin panels, dashboards and data-heavy interfaces where maintainability, performance
          and clean architecture matter.
